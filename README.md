Tips Calculator is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Mandy Woo

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [1] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [1] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [1] total and tip labels will automatically update whenever anyone types in the text box so that you don't have to press on a new tip percentage to see change, default tip percentage would be used
- [1] allowed for larger totals

## Notes

Challenges included figuring why nothing would change after inputting a bill amount. I thought there was something wrong with the connections but found out that a tip percentage other than the default needed to be chosen which was a flaw in the suggested implementation.
